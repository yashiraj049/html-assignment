Q5.Why do we use meta tags?

Meta tags are HTML elements that provide metadata that is information about a webpage to browsers and search engines. 
They are placed inside the <head> section of an HTML document and help in SEO, responsiveness, and improving webpage performance.
Meta tags are used to provide additional information about a webpage to search engines, helping them understand the content and relevance of a page,
thus impacting how it appears in search results, and ultimately influencing how many people click through to your website; 
essentially acting as a way to "describe" your page to search engines so they can categorize and display it appropriately

Uses of Meta Tags

- search Engine Optimization (SEO): Helps search engines understand the content of the page.
- Responsive Design: Ensures the website adapts to different screen sizes.
- Faster Page Loading: Controls caching and resource preloading.
- Social Media Sharing: Defines how a webpage appears when shared.
