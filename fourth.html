Q4.What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.

Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that have meaningful names, which clearly describe their purpose in a webpage. 
These elements improve readability, accessibility, and SEO by giving structure to the content.
For example, instead of using a <div> to create a navigation bar, you can use <nav>, which clearly indicates its purpose.

Benefits of Semantic HTML:

Improves Code Readability – Makes it easier to understand and maintain.
Enhances SEO – Search engines better understand the webpage structure.
Increases Accessibility – Assistive technologies (like screen readers) interpret content more effectively. 
Better Browser Compatibility – Helps modern browsers display content properly.
